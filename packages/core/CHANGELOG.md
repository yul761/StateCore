## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#4](https://github.com/yul761/StateCore/pull/4) [`c885c8c`](https://github.com/yul761/StateCore/commit/c885c8caf52007e2f43bf3c63be9874297843df9) Thanks [@yul761](https://github.com/yul761)! - `GET /v1/memory/facts` items carry an additive-optional `factId` — the fact-registry evidence-chain id for that item, or `null` when unmatched (contract `1.7.0`). `attachFactIds`, previously local to `apps/mcp`, is now exported from `@statecore/core` so both the API and the embedded MCP backend join the same id from a single implementation.

## 1.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Ship `main` pointing at `dist`, so a built app starts anywhere

  All four packages pointed `main` at `src/index.ts`, which Node cannot execute.
  The Docker image worked only because a stage rewrote those four package.json
  files to `dist` before the runtime started, which made the image the one place a
  built app could be started — every other consumer of the same build died on
  `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '{'` from the `.ts` entry. That is what the
  integration smoke workflow had been failing on, behind the pgvector failure that
  hid it.

  `main` is now `dist/index.js` and the rewrite stage is gone. `types` still points
  at `src/index.ts`: TypeScript resolves it through the node_modules symlink, which
  is exempt from the importing package's `rootDir` check, and mapping these names
  through `paths` instead fails every build with TS6059.

  Consumers inside this repository need nothing beyond what already landed with it
  — Vitest aliases the names back to source through `vitest.shared.ts`, and `tsx`
  reads `tsconfig.dev.json`. A consumer resolving these packages by `main` now gets
  built JavaScript and must build first.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- `POST /v1/memory/retrieve` accepts an optional context budget.

  The endpoint took an item count (`limit`) and could not take a budget, so the
  "a few large items or many small ones" tradeoff — the one that decides what a
  caller actually gets at a tight budget — was a decision only the engine could
  make and had no way to hear about. Callers filled the gap themselves: one
  reimplemented it in eighty lines, another simply took the first forty facts.

  Pass `maxChars` and the engine packs within it and reports what it refused, in a
  new top-level optional `budget` field. Ordering is digest, then facts, then
  events. The digest is atomic. Facts take at most `FACT_BUDGET_SHARE` (40%) of
  the budget so raw evidence always has room, and are ranked by relevance to the
  query when one is given — by confidence and recency when it is not. Items are
  included whole or skipped; an item that does not fit never ends the fill, since
  a smaller one ranked below it may still belong.

  Everything refused is recorded with a reason and a score. Exact counts are never
  truncated; the itemised list is bounded at 100 and says how many it omitted. A
  budget means dropping things, and a response that quietly holds less than the
  caller asked for is the defect class this engine exists to remove.

  Additive and optional throughout: a request without `maxChars` gets byte-identical
  behaviour, and the frozen `/v1` surface gains only optional fields.

### Patch Changes

- [`8317037`](https://github.com/yul761/StateCore/commit/8317037e34aae3eb2933f8db8676c3a7dc77b35f) Thanks [@yul761](https://github.com/yul761)! - Stop whole sessions and documents from being written into the fact registry.

  Three paths promoted `event.content` verbatim — facet routing, decisions, and
  constraints. With a chat message that is about the size of a statement, so the
  defect stayed invisible in the assistant use case. With a session or a document
  it is not: the fact layer became a second copy of the corpus and, because every
  consumer reads it against a context budget, those copies crowded out the facts
  extraction had actually produced. Measured on LongMemEval at session
  granularity: 87% of registry entries over 1000 tokens, median 2691, against
  genuine extracted facts of 11-27 tokens — roughly 100:1.

  A fact is now bounded at `MAX_FACT_CHARS` (500) at every write path, with a
  `fact_too_long` drop record so the refusal is auditable rather than silent. The
  bound is on what gets written, not on the event it came from: a long
  conversation yielding a short fact is unaffected.

- [`0d6d75d`](https://github.com/yul761/StateCore/commit/0d6d75d0e2c4a0758149b6f5be99a1bdce97ea4a) Thanks [@yul761](https://github.com/yul761)! - Extract from the whole corpus, not the first prompt-full of it.

  Stage 2 clipped its `deltaCandidates` section at 60k characters and dropped the
  remainder, so on any corpus larger than one prompt the extractor only ever saw
  the beginning. On LongMemEval that was ~490k characters of sessions against a
  60k window — about 12% reaching extraction. Bulk import (`ingest:docs`) hits the
  same wall, and the shortfall was invisible because the verbatim promotion paths
  were separately copying every event into the fact registry.

  Stage 2 now runs one pass per prompt-sized chunk, threading each pass's output
  forward as the next pass's `lastDigest` so the summary accumulates the way
  consecutive incremental digests do, and unioning the extracted facts.
  `STAGE2_MAX_CHUNKS` bounds the work per run; events beyond it stay in the store
  for the next one.

- Keep the facts a stage-2 pass extracted when that pass degrades.

  Chunking stage 2 threads each chunk's output forward as the next chunk's
  `lastDigest`, which makes a consistency trip likely — consecutive chunks of one
  corpus describe similar changes. Every degraded return in the pass discarded
  `profileFacts`, so one trip threw away everything that pass had extracted.
  Observed live: a digest that completed in 344s, reported success, and wrote zero
  facts.

  The extracted facts now survive all three degraded returns, and a failing chunk
  no longer takes the whole corpus with it — before chunking a throw cost one
  digest; after it, it would have cost every remaining pass.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Give every domain the facets its classifier vocabulary routes into.

  Scope templates and facet packs were two extensibility mechanisms at two
  granularities, and only `personal` happened to line up. `health` classified
  events as `medical_fact`, `learning` as `knowledge_claim`, `project` as
  `decision` — and the account-level pack routed from none of them, so for three
  of the four templates (including the default) stage-1 classification produced
  labels that landed nowhere.

  A domain now carries both halves. `project`, `health` and `learning` gain facet
  packs whose `routesFrom` names their own entity types, and a scope's pack is
  resolved from its template — one choice, already in the public contract and
  already self-service, settling both the input and the state vocabulary.

  An account-level `User.facetPack` still wins when set, for a tenant whose domain
  none of the built-ins describe.

  This means one account can run several scopes with different ontologies, which
  is what a customer building more than one product needs. Note that API keys do
  not scope: every key on an account can reach all of its scopes, so keys are a
  rotation mechanism, not an isolation boundary.

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Close the three gaps 1.2.0 left open.

  **Contradiction accumulation now has a defence.** Two incompatible facts could
  sit in the same protected facet indefinitely; nothing looked at the resulting
  state, only at the digest's prose. Consolidation — which already runs on every
  digest that touches a facet — now receives each item's provenance and is
  instructed to resolve contradictions by keeping the document-sourced side. The
  losing side is retired as `consolidation_dropped`, so the rejected belief stays
  on the record. No additional model call.

  **A tenant's pack can now drive the classifier.** A pack could declare
  `routesFrom: ["case_event"]`, but nothing ever emitted `case_event`: the four
  built-in DomainConfigs are the only classification vocabularies, and each names
  its own. When a tenant has installed a custom pack, the classification prompt is
  now derived from the types that pack routes from. Tenants on the default pack
  keep their DomainConfig prompt unchanged.

  **Grounding evidence reports its own truncation.** `eventSnippets` shows the
  first five events behind an answer; it now also carries `eventSnippetsTotal`.
  Answering "here is why I said that" with 5 of 30 and no indication is the same
  silent truncation this engine exists to avoid.

  Audit note: the retrieval layer was reviewed for silent loss and none was found
  — every limit there is either the caller's requested `limit` or already reported
  in the `retrieval` metadata.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Make the auditability guarantee real, and make the ontology the tenant's.

  This release came out of investigating a LongMemEval comparison whose numbers
  turned out to be an artifact. The investigation found that several of the
  engine's stated guarantees did not hold in the code, so the work is mostly
  repair.

  **Auditability**

  - Fact history survives. `normalizeDigestState` rebuilt the registry as
    `.filter(e => !e.supersededBy).slice(-100)`, and the previous state is
    normalised on every run, so each digest deleted the supersession history it
    inherited — a fact's chain existed only until the next digest. Active facts
    are now never dropped on load, and history is kept to a bounded most-recent
    500 entries.
  - Capacity eviction and facet consolidation retire records instead of deleting
    them. Consolidation runs on every digest that touches a facet, so this was
    breaking the chain on the common path, not a rare one.
  - Every discard is recorded with a reason and persisted to `Digest.selectionLog`.
    Eight places could previously drop information with no trace.
  - New: `GET /v1/memory/facts/:factId/provenance` returns a fact's evidence and
    its full version chain from any version in it.
  - New: `GET /v1/memory/digests/:digestId/selection` returns what a digest kept
    and what it discarded.

  **Drift**

  - Write protection now applies on the path that runs every digest. It existed
    only on the classifier-driven path, so a 0.6-authority sentence from chat could
    supersede a 0.85-authority fact taken from an uploaded document.
  - A document-authority facet with no document in the run no longer writes a fact
    the registry has no record of.
  - The protected-fact contradiction check was dead: key tokens were taken from a
    list that puts ASCII first, so dates ("2019-2022") crowded out the terms that
    identify the fact and the check never fired. Protected facts are full of dates.
  - `checkContradiction` now sees write-protected profile facts, not just
    `stableFacts`.
  - Drift metrics observe the fact registry, where user facts actually live.

  **Ontology**

  - The seven personal-life facets are no longer wired into the engine. They lived
    in eight places that could drift apart; they are now one replaceable pack, and
    the core stores, protects, supersedes and retrieves without knowing what a
    facet means.
  - Packs resolve per tenant from `User.facetPack`, not per process. A cloud
    account maps 1:1 onto a core user, so one deployment can serve customers with
    different ontologies.
  - Facets declare their own stage-1 routing, display group, capacity, protection
    and document authority.

  **Retention**

  - New: `pinned` on an ingested event means it must not lose a budget
    competition. Documents already outranked chat, but they competed with each
    other by recency, so the oldest — typically a durable one like a resume,
    uploaded once — was dropped first.
  - Updated documents re-trigger the digest. The "anything new" check compared
    `createdAt` only, and an upsert keeps it, so re-uploading a corrected document
    changed the stored document and nothing else.
  - Per-facet capacity is configurable via `DIGEST_FACET_CAPS`.

  **Behaviour change worth knowing**

  Conversation can no longer add facts to a document-authority facet (`identity`
  in the default pack) when the run has no document. Previously such facts were
  written to the profile with no registry entry behind them — visible but
  unciteable and impossible to supersede. Updating a document by re-uploading it
  remains the supported path and works. Rejections appear in the selection log as
  `no_document_evidence`.
