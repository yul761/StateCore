# StateCore — Claude Context

## What this is
StateCore is an AI memory management system. It stores memory events, runs digest workers to build stable state, and serves a REST API for ingestion and recall.

It is the **Layer 1 engine** of the `StateCore-App` stack (see `../CLAUDE.md`): open-source
(MIT), self-hostable, and fronted by `../statecore-cloud` (managed gateway) which
`../assistant-backend` uses as its memory store. Tech: **pnpm + Turbo monorepo**
(`apps/*`, `packages/*`), TypeScript, Node ≥20 (apps/mcp: ≥22.13, it uses node:sqlite), NestJS, Prisma/Postgres+pgvector,
BullMQ/Redis, Zod, Vitest, Changesets.

## Commands
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev:api          # API only (port 3002)
pnpm dev:worker       # background workers (digest, working memory, reminders)
pnpm dev:lite         # = dev:api
pnpm test:core        # Vitest suite for @statecore/core
pnpm lint             # tsc --noEmit across apps + packages
pnpm build            # build all apps + packages
pnpm changeset        # add a changeset (releases via Changesets)
pnpm benchmark        # synthetic memory-quality benchmark suite
```

`changeset version` needs a token for its changelog generator:
`GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" pnpm exec changeset version`. Releases are manual
— version, commit, tag with `apps/api`'s version, `gh release create`. Every
package is `private: true` except `apps/mcp` (`statecore-mcp`), the one package
that publishes to npm — see `apps/mcp/README.md`.

## Module resolution — read before touching package.json or tsconfig

The four library packages point `main` at `dist/index.js` and `types` at
`src/index.ts`. That split is deliberate and load-bearing:

- `main` → `dist` because `node dist/main.js` cannot load a `.ts` entry. The
  Dockerfile used to rewrite these four package.json files at image build time,
  which meant the image was the only place a built app could start.
- `types` → `src` so type-checking and building need no prior build. **Do not
  "fix" this with tsconfig `paths`** — mapping these names to real paths puts the
  files under the importing package's `rootDir` and fails every build with
  TS6059. Resolution through the node_modules symlink is exempt from that check.
- Vitest reads `main`, so `vitest.shared.ts` aliases the names back to source.
  A package that runs tests needs a `vitest.config.ts` importing it, or its
  suite silently runs against stale `dist`.
- `tsx` reads `main` too, so `pnpm dev:*` and the tsx-run scripts pass
  `--tsconfig ../../tsconfig.dev.json`, which carries the paths tsc cannot.

## Running locally
- API: `http://localhost:3002` (set in `.env`: `PORT=3002`)
- Auth: `x-user-id: local-dev-user` header (token set in `.env`: `LOCAL_USER_TOKEN=local-dev-user`)
- Start: `pnpm dev:api` + `pnpm dev:worker` (there is no root `start` script; `start.ps1` is the Windows wrapper)

### Enable semantic retrieval (optional)
Add to `.env`:
```
MODEL_EMBEDDING_NAME=text-embedding-3-small
RETRIEVE_USE_EMBEDDINGS=true
```
Uses the same API key as the LLM. Restart the API container after changing. Health endpoint shows `"retrieve":{"useEmbeddings":true}` when active.

## StateCore Memory API (key endpoints)

### Ingest a document
```
POST /memory/events
x-user-id: local-dev-user
{ "scopeId": "<uuid>", "type": "document", "source": "api", "key": "<unique-slug>", "content": "<text>" }
```
- `type: "document"` = long-form, keyed, upsertable by key
- `type: "stream"` = short ephemeral facts/events

### List scopes
```
GET /scopes
x-user-id: local-dev-user
```
Returns array of `{ id, name }`.

### Trigger digest (LLM summarization)
```
POST /memory/digest
x-user-id: local-dev-user
{ "scopeId": "<uuid>" }
```

### Retrieve memory
```
POST /memory/retrieve
{ "scopeId": "<uuid>", "query": "...", "limit": 20, "maxChars": 16000 }
```
`maxChars` is optional. With it, the engine packs whole items within the budget
and reports what it refused in a top-level `budget` field; without it, behaviour
is unchanged.

### Audit the memory
```
GET /v1/memory/facts?scopeId=<uuid>              # grouped displayable facts
GET /v1/memory/facts/<factId>/provenance?scopeId=<uuid>   # evidence + version chain
GET /v1/memory/digests/<digestId>/selection      # what a digest kept and dropped
GET /v1/facet-pack?scopeId=<uuid>                # the active facet ontology
```
These are the product's differentiator, not diagnostics. Facts are never deleted:
a replaced fact carries `supersededBy`, and one evicted or forgotten carries
`retiredAt`/`retiredReason`.

### Contract rules
`/v1` is frozen and additive-only — 22 operations across 20 paths, registered in
`PublicV1Contracts` (`packages/contracts/src/index.ts`). Serving a handler at
`/v1` without registering it there is the drift that shipped twice;
`v1-surface-guard.integration.test.ts` now fails on it. Full rules in
`docs/api.md`.

## Model constraint

On OpenAI, use a model that accepts `reasoning_effort`. `assistant-runtime.ts`
defaults it to `"low"` rather than leaving it unset, so **every** runtime turn
sends it and `gpt-4o*` models reject the request. Digest and answers do not send
it unless `MODEL_STRUCTURED_OUTPUT_REASONING_EFFORT` is set — so a gpt-4o model
ingests, digests and retrieves fine, then fails on the first
`POST /v1/memory/runtime/turn`.

## Bulk document ingest script
To ingest an entire folder of markdown files into a scope:
```
pnpm ingest:docs --dir "C:\path\to\docs" --scope "scope-name-or-uuid"
```
Options:
- `--token <token>` — override auth token (default: local-dev-user)
- `--url <url>` — override API base URL (default: http://localhost:3002)
- `--ext .md,.txt` — file extensions to include (default: .md)
- `--no-digest` — skip digest trigger after ingestion
- `--dry-run` — preview without sending

Script: `scripts/ingest-docs.ts`

## Scopes
Scopes are per-user and dynamic — do not hardcode a list here. List the current
user's scopes via `GET /scopes` (auth header `x-user-id`).

## Architecture quick-ref
- `apps/api` (`@statecore/api`) — NestJS HTTP server, port 3002; serves the stable `/v1` API
- `apps/worker` (`@statecore/worker`) — BullMQ background workers (digest, working memory, reminders)
- `apps/mcp` (`statecore-mcp`) — MCP front end; embedded (SQLite, keyless) by default, or a thin client against `/v1` via `--url`. The one package published to npm
- `packages/core` — MemoryService, DigestService, RetrieveService, AnswerService, AssistantSession, digest-control pipeline
- `packages/db` — Prisma schema, migrations, client (Postgres + pgvector)
- `packages/contracts` — Zod schemas for all API I/O
- `packages/prompts` — LLM prompt templates (digest, answer, runtime)

## Key files
- `apps/api/src/memory.controller.ts` — all memory endpoints
- `apps/api/src/domain.service.ts` — service orchestration
- `apps/api/src/auth.middleware.ts` — x-user-id / x-telegram-user-id auth
- `packages/core/src/index.ts` — MemoryService, DigestService, AnswerService exports
- `packages/core/src/digest-control.ts` — the digest pipeline and `DigestState`, including `factRegistry` and `retireFact`
- `packages/core/src/facet-registry.ts` — the facet ontology; **the single source of truth.** Facets carry their own cap, write protection, display group, document authority and stage-1 routing. The engine stores and supersedes without knowing what a facet means, so do not reintroduce a hardcoded facet table
- `packages/core/src/drop-log.ts` — the fixed set of reasons a fact can be discarded
- `packages/contracts/src/index.ts` — Zod schemas, and `PublicV1Contracts` (the frozen surface)

## Deploy (droplet `statecore` → api.statecore.io)
Git-pull based, from a checkout at `/root/StateCore` on the `statecore` droplet
(137.184.45.203). That host runs **both** the core stack (`statecore-api`,
`statecore-worker`, `statecore-postgres` [pgvector], `statecore-redis`) **and** the
statecore-cloud stack (gateway/console/docs/caddy) — the cloud gateway proxies to core
over the docker bridge. Source of truth: `deploy.md`.
**⚠️ `-f compose.deploy.yml` is not optional.** It is an untracked host override that
publishes core's port 3000 to `127.0.0.1:3002` and `172.17.0.1:3002` (the docker0
bridge). The cloud gateway finds core at `CORE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3002`,
which resolves to that bridge IP. Recreate the `api` container without this override
and the port binding silently disappears: core stays healthy and logs a clean startup,
the gateway stays up, and **every request through api.statecore.io returns 502**.
Because the file is untracked, `git pull` does not carry it and nothing fails loudly.
This is how prod broke on 2026-08-09 (4h outage) — the command block below used to
omit it, so it is now baked into every line.

```bash
ssh statecore
cd /root/StateCore
git pull origin main

# Define once, so no invocation can drift from another.
DC="docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f compose.deploy.yml --env-file .env.production"

$DC build
$DC run --rm migrate            # one-shot Prisma migrate; run before `up` on schema changes
$DC up -d api worker
```

**Verify through the gateway, not just core.** Core's own health passing proves
nothing about the path Remi actually uses — that was the gap that let the 502 sit
unnoticed for four hours:
```bash
# on the droplet: core is published where the gateway expects it
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://127.0.0.1:3002/v1/health   # want 200
docker inspect statecore-api-1 --format '{{json .HostConfig.PortBindings}}'  # must NOT be {}

# end-to-end, from the consumer's side (assistant-backend holds the sc_live_ key):
ssh remi "cd /root/assistant-backend && docker compose exec -T api node -e '
  fetch(process.env.STATECORE_BASE_URL + \"/v1/scopes\", {
    headers: { authorization: \"Bearer \" + process.env.STATECORE_API_KEY }
  }).then(r => console.log(r.status))'"                                    # want 200
```

Notes: there's a dedicated one-shot `migrate` service. Compose files:
`docker-compose.prod.yml` (prod), `compose.deploy.yml` (untracked host override — see
warning above), `docker-compose.local.yml` (local).
