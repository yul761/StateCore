# Digest State Specification

This document defines the role, structure, and evolution rules for `DigestState`.

In the three-layer architecture, `DigestState` should be read as the internal State Layer representation.
It remains the authoritative protected memory layer, but it is no longer the only memory layer in the system.

`DigestState` is the protected State Layer memory that sits between raw events and generated digests. It exists to reduce drift by giving the system a stable, structured memory representation that does not depend entirely on free-form summary text.

## Purpose

`DigestState` should be treated as a first-class State Layer artifact.

Its job is to:

- preserve stable facts across long-running interaction
- separate durable memory from temporary context
- provide deterministic input to digest generation
- support contradiction checks
- support replay, rebuild, and auditing

Without a protected state layer, the system must repeatedly infer memory from previous digest text, which increases ambiguity and drift risk.

It is distinct from:

- Fast Layer context
- Working Memory snapshots

## Current State in the Repository

The current implementation stores `DigestState` with five top-level sections:

- `stableFacts`
- `workingNotes`
- `todos`
- `volatileContext`
- `evidenceRefs`

Current shape:

```ts
interface DigestState {
  stableFacts: {
    goal?: string;
    constraints?: string[];
    decisions: string[];
  };
  workingNotes: {
    openQuestions?: string[];
    risks?: string[];
    context?: string;
  };
  todos: string[];
  volatileContext?: string[];
  evidenceRefs?: Array<{
    id: string;
    sourceType: "document" | "event";
    key?: string;
    kind?: MemoryEventKind;
  }>;
}
```

This exists in:

- `packages/core/src/digest-control.ts`
- `packages/contracts/src/index.ts`

This is already useful, but it is still an early State Layer model rather than the final intended state design.

## Design Goals

The long-term `DigestState` design should optimize for:

- stability under repeated digesting
- explicit separation of durable vs temporary information
- evidence-aware updates
- conservative overwrite behavior
- replay and rebuild consistency
- benchmark-friendly inspection

## State Layers

`DigestState` should distinguish information by durability.

### 1. Stable Facts

Stable facts are project-level facts that should persist until explicitly changed or superseded.

Examples:

- project goal
- hard constraints
- accepted decisions
- durable operating assumptions

Stable facts should be the hardest part of state to overwrite.

### 2. Working Notes

Working notes are useful but less durable than stable facts.

Examples:

- current risks
- open questions
- intermediate reasoning
- recent project context

Working notes may decay, roll forward, or be pruned more aggressively.

### 3. Volatile Context

Volatile context is short-lived information that helps the next few turns but should not silently become permanent memory.

Examples:

- temporary blockers
- short-term priorities
- conversational noise worth keeping briefly
- near-term execution focus

The current implementation already has a `volatileContext` field, but it is still a lightweight string list rather than a richer typed record layer.

### 4. Todos

Todos are operational commitments and should remain separate from prose notes.

They should not be mixed into `workingNotes.context`, because task continuity is one of the core dimensions of drift measurement.

## Recommended Target Shape

The roadmap target should move toward a richer state model like:

```ts
interface DigestStateV2 {
  stableFacts: {
    goal?: FactRecord;
    constraints: FactRecord[];
    decisions: DecisionRecord[];
  };
  workingNotes: {
    openQuestions: NoteRecord[];
    risks: NoteRecord[];
  };
  volatileContext: ContextRecord[];
  todos: TodoRecord[];
  evidenceRefs: EvidenceRef[];
}
```

This document does not require that exact schema yet, but it defines the intended semantics behind it.

## Why the Current Shape Is Not Enough

The current shape has three practical limitations:

1. It still stores most state entries as plain strings.
2. It does not clearly separate temporary context from longer-lived notes.
3. It only partially encodes provenance today: `evidenceRefs` are structured, but facts, todos, and notes do not yet carry their own evidence metadata.

That makes it harder to answer:

- why a fact was added
- whether a fact can be replaced
- what evidence justified a state transition
- whether replay produced the same state for the same reasons

The current codebase has now moved one step beyond this limitation:

- state snapshots carry top-level `provenance`
- state snapshots carry `recentChanges`

This is still lighter than a full record-per-fact model, but it means the system can now answer:

- which evidence most recently justified a goal or todo
- which fields changed during the latest protected-state merge
- whether replay produced the same state with similar recent transitions

## State Record Semantics

Future state elements should carry more than text.

### Fact Records

A stable fact should eventually support fields such as:

- canonical text
- source evidence ids
- confidence
- first seen timestamp
- last reaffirmed timestamp
- superseded or active status

### Decision Records

Decisions should eventually support:

- decision text
- source evidence ids
- decision status such as active or superseded
- optional supersedes pointer
- timestamp metadata

### Todo Records

Todos should eventually support:

- todo text
- status such as open, completed, canceled, blocked, duplicate
- source evidence ids
- optional owner or scope tags
- created and updated timestamps

### Note Records

Working notes should eventually support:

- note text
- note kind such as risk or question
- source evidence ids
- recency metadata

## Evolution Rules

The state should evolve conservatively.

### Rule 1: Prefer append over overwrite

For stable facts and decisions, new evidence should usually append, reaffirm, supersede, or explicitly revoke. Silent replacement should be avoided.

### Rule 2: Require stronger evidence to change stable facts

A weak conversational note should not override a stable goal or hard constraint. Updates to stable facts should require explicit and stronger evidence.

### Rule 3: Treat removal as a first-class operation

Removing a constraint, decision, or todo should require explicit evidence rather than passive disappearance.

### Rule 4: Separate durable truth from temporary context

If a piece of information is only relevant for a short time, it should land in volatile context or a note layer, not in stable facts.

### Rule 5: Preserve evidence linkage

Every important state transition should be explainable in terms of source documents, stream events, or prior accepted state.

### Rule 6: Preserve replay determinism

Running the same event sequence through the same merge logic should produce the same protected state unless configuration changes.

## Merge Semantics

The current `protectedStateMerge()` already applies conservative behavior:

- documents can set goals and contribute constraints or todos
- decisions append rather than replace
- constraints append when strong enough
- todos append uniquely
- questions and risks accumulate in capped note lists

That is a solid baseline, but the next evolution should formalize four merge outcomes:

1. `append`
2. `reaffirm`
3. `supersede`
4. `reject`

Each important incoming candidate should resolve to one of these outcomes.

## Snapshot Semantics

Each accepted digest should persist a snapshot of protected state.

Snapshot persistence matters because it allows the system to:

- avoid reconstructing state from free-form text
- compare state transitions over time
- audit why drift occurred
- replay from a known state boundary

The current schema already stores `DigestStateSnapshot` as JSON linked to a digest. That is the correct direction and should remain central to the architecture.

## Relationship to Drift

`DigestState` is one of the main mechanisms for reducing:

- goal drift
- constraint drift
- decision drift
- todo drift

If `DigestState` is weak, digest text becomes the de facto memory source, and drift becomes harder to prevent and harder to measure.

## Relationship to Consistency Checks

Consistency checks should treat protected state as a guardrail.

Examples:

- summaries should not contradict `stableFacts.goal`
- changes should not violate preserved constraints
- next steps should not invent unsupported todos
- answer generation should not override protected state without evidence

As the state model becomes richer, consistency checks should use more than plain string inclusion and move toward evidence-aware comparisons.

## Implementation Guidance

The next implementation steps should follow this order:

1. Keep the current `DigestState` shape stable enough for existing code paths.
2. Define a versioned successor shape before expanding runtime behavior.
3. Add provenance fields before adding more semantic categories.
4. Add `volatileContext` and richer todo status handling.
5. Introduce explicit supersede and rejection semantics in merge logic.
6. Add replay tests that compare state snapshots, not just digest text.

## Migration Strategy

The safest migration path is incremental.

### Stage 1

Document the semantics of the current fields and use them consistently.

### Stage 2

Add optional metadata fields compatible with the current snapshot JSON format.

### Stage 3

Introduce richer record types and migrate merge logic to produce them.

### Stage 4

Update benchmarks and drift analysis to score state continuity using richer fields.

## Immediate Practical Standard

Until a richer schema is implemented, contributors should treat the current state fields like this:

- `stableFacts.goal`: the best current project goal, changed only by explicit evidence
- `stableFacts.constraints`: hard or durable constraints that should persist
- `stableFacts.decisions`: decisions that should remain continuous across digests
- `workingNotes.openQuestions`: unresolved questions worth carrying forward briefly
- `workingNotes.risks`: active risks or blockers
- `workingNotes.context`: limited free-form context, not a dumping ground for stable facts
- `todos`: active action items that should remain visible until resolved

## Success Criteria

`DigestState` is doing its job when:

- core goals remain stable across long interaction
- constraints are not silently lost
- decisions remain continuous or are explicitly superseded
- todos are preserved without multiplying into noise
- rebuilds reproduce compatible state snapshots
- contradictions can be detected against structured state rather than loose digest text
