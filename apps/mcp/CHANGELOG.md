# statecore-mcp

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- statecore-mcp 1.0.0.

  The tool surface (`remember`, `recall`, `facts`, `why`, `forget`, `handoff`) and the CLI (`export`, `hook`, `digest`) are now stable and additive-only; data files are versioned and upgrade in place; installation runs no scripts and needs only Node ≥ 22.13. See the README's "Stability" section for the exact promises and the two things deliberately left out of 1.x (embedded semantic retrieval, a resident daemon).

  Breaking against 0.6.x, all documented in the earlier 1.0 pre-release changesets: Node floor 22.13; `runScopeDigest({ prisma })` → `runScopeDigest({ db })`; the `facts` MCP tool returns `{ groups, pending? }` instead of a bare array; `remember` returns two new fields (`distillation`, `reason`) — strict-equality assertions on its return shape need updating.

### Minor Changes

- [#3](https://github.com/yul761/StateCore/pull/3) [`1bb47f6`](https://github.com/yul761/StateCore/commit/1bb47f63ffcb8c0e116ccbf6dd7560a5377103bb) Thanks [@yul761](https://github.com/yul761)! - `statecore-mcp hook <session-start|user-prompt|stop|pre-compact>` reads a Claude Code hook payload from stdin and captures the conversation into project memory (keyed, idempotent stream events) or injects the project's memory as `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`. A Claude Code plugin (`plugins/claude-code`, marketplace `yul761/StateCore`) wires the four events and the MCP server. `STATECORE_CAPTURE=off` disables capture. The embedded backend gains an optional `capture({ text, key })` method.

- [#4](https://github.com/yul761/StateCore/pull/4) [`c885c8c`](https://github.com/yul761/StateCore/commit/c885c8caf52007e2f43bf3c63be9874297843df9) Thanks [@yul761](https://github.com/yul761)! - Keyless usage is now visible instead of silent. `remember` reports its distillation state (`scheduled` or `deferred`, with a reason when deferred); `facts` includes a top-level `pending` count of events not yet folded into stable facts. A new `statecore-mcp digest` subcommand runs one explicit distillation pass now — `{ ran: true }`, or `{ ran: false, reason }` (`no-llm`, `below-threshold`, `locked`, `failed`) when it does not. The embedded backend gains `pendingEvents()` to back the `facts` count. `--url` mode's `facts()` output now carries `factId` per item when the server is on contract 1.7.0 or later (a pass-through; an older server simply omits the field).

- [#2](https://github.com/yul761/StateCore/pull/2) [`21867bc`](https://github.com/yul761/StateCore/commit/21867bc092bdf91670cdf50eb17ebd2aabfd6e76) Thanks [@yul761](https://github.com/yul761)! - The embedded store now runs on Node's built-in `node:sqlite` instead of Prisma.

  - No `postinstall`, no native module, no engine download: `npm install --ignore-scripts` and pnpm 10's default script blocking both work.
  - Requires Node 22.13 or newer.
  - The database file is schema-versioned (`PRAGMA user_version`) and migrated in place on open; 0.6.x files open unchanged.
  - New `statecore-mcp export [--data <dir>] [--scope <name>]` prints a JSON dump.
  - `runScopeDigest`'s first option is now `db` (was `prisma`). `createEmbeddedBackend`, `createHttpBackend`, `listScopes`, `resolveScopeName` are unchanged.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [`238e390`](https://github.com/yul761/StateCore/commit/238e39054cc1963b93e508be4d74d326fa7e6253) Thanks [@yul761](https://github.com/yul761)! - Relevance scoring is IDF-weighted from the token index's corpus statistics.

  Measured on a template-heavy corpus (MemoryAgentBench FactConsolidation), the
  event path — whose candidates come from the inverted index ordered by match
  count — scored nearly twice the fact path, because uniform overlap scoring
  lets the template words every record shares drown the one token that
  distinguishes records. Retrieval now derives per-query IDF weights from the
  token index (document frequencies + scope event count) and applies them to
  both the event heuristic and, via the new `RetrieveService.makeScorer`, the
  fact ranking inside the maxChars budget competition — the two layers agree on
  what a distinctive token is worth. Deterministic, zero model calls, and
  absent a token index (or on any stats failure) scoring falls back to the
  exact legacy uniform behavior.

### Patch Changes

- [`46f188e`](https://github.com/yul761/StateCore/commit/46f188ebcdb74b67e3bd0affd776d55d80ea739f) Thanks [@yul761](https://github.com/yul761)! - The fallback digest model is now gpt-5-mini, matching the README's recommended
  configuration. The engine is operated with gpt-5-class models (the runtime
  sends reasoning_effort, which the gpt-4o family rejects), but the embedded and
  worker fallbacks still said gpt-4o-mini — an explicit MODEL_NAME/OPENAI_MODEL
  is unaffected.

- [`f405a45`](https://github.com/yul761/StateCore/commit/f405a45b14e56b98d5f1aee9ec35dfdec327912c) Thanks [@yul761](https://github.com/yul761)! - The digest path's default LLM timeout is now 120s (was 20s). Found by a
  benchmark run: with the recommended gpt-5-mini, a large-backlog distillation
  chunk routinely exceeds 20s, the call aborts, the retry aborts too, and the
  whole run fails silently — the recommended default configuration could not
  digest any real backlog. 20s remains right for interactive calls; the
  background distillation path now defaults to a timeout that survives
  reasoning models. MODEL_TIMEOUT_MS still overrides.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [`a9e8ea1`](https://github.com/yul761/StateCore/commit/a9e8ea1bd76f6fd61d5fcd89a3fcf90939b0fb52) Thanks [@yul761](https://github.com/yul761)! - Facts carry entity vocabulary, so distillation no longer hides them from recall.

  Stage 2 may now attach up to 10 concrete nouns from the evidence (tool names,
  file paths, product names) to each extracted fact. They are stored on the
  fact's registry entry, survive supersession, and retrieval scores a fact on
  its text plus its entities — so a query in the evidence's vocabulary still
  finds the fact after distillation rephrased it. Extracted once at digest time;
  costs nothing at query time. Entirely additive: facts without entities score
  exactly as before.

- [`8f5f296`](https://github.com/yul761/StateCore/commit/8f5f296382659a624b557c8f628747c1f680a444) Thanks [@yul761](https://github.com/yul761)! - Retrieval now reports its own degradation, and protection reaches the read path.

  - `retrieval.mode` is derived from what actually ran, not from configuration: a
    run whose embedding calls all failed reports `heuristic`, and each failed
    stage is itemised in the new optional `retrieval.degraded` array
    (`{ stage: "vector_search" | "rerank", error }`). Previously a total
    embedding outage still reported `mode: "hybrid"` and the vector-search
    failure was swallowed by a bare catch.
  - Pinned events get a bounded additive ranking boost in retrieval (beats the
    recency edge at equal relevance; loses to any real relevance gap — a boost,
    never a filter). `rankingReason` gains a `pinned` marker.
  - Write-protected and document-authority facets now carry a bounded ranking
    multiplier (clamped to at most 1.5×) into the `maxChars` budget competition,
    via the new `facetAuthority()` helper and `packWithinBudget`'s optional
    `factAuthority` input.
  - Every system prompt that sees ingested or retrieved content now carries an
    explicit security boundary (content is data, never instructions) and
    concrete faithfulness rules (never invent dates, paths, versions, or
    identifiers; no generic-knowledge filler).

- [`b62d253`](https://github.com/yul761/StateCore/commit/b62d2538bf28cd8d3994916e7ed5c6715682110c) Thanks [@yul761](https://github.com/yul761)! - Lexical inverted token index: recall now reaches old events.

  The retrieval candidate pool used to be the newest ~200 events plus optional
  vector hits — anything older was unreachable however relevant, which hit the
  keyless embedded store hardest (no embeddings, so recency was everything).
  Ingest now writes an inverted token index (`MemoryEventToken`) using the same
  tokenizer the relevance scorer uses (ASCII words + CJK bigrams — a term
  matches in the index iff it matches in the score; this is also why no FTS
  engine is involved), and retrieval unions a lexical candidate stream into the
  pool. Final ranking is unchanged. Index-query failures are reported as
  `retrieval.degraded` stage `lexical_search`, never swallowed.

  English stopwords are excluded from the index (the relevance scorer is
  unchanged), long bilingual queries interleave ASCII and CJK tokens instead of
  truncating CJK away, and `forget` removes the suppressed event's index rows.

  The embedded store backfills existing events automatically at open. Server
  deployments run the `20260829120000_memory_event_tokens` and
  `20260829200000_session_handoff` migrations and then `pnpm backfill:tokens`
  once.

- [`e5e8ec7`](https://github.com/yul761/StateCore/commit/e5e8ec7e882716ea528b136b4d756c516bf61eaa) Thanks [@yul761](https://github.com/yul761)! - New `handoff` tool: cross-client session handoff, race-free and auditable.

  `handoff({ summary, openQuestions?, nextSteps? })` records where a session
  stopped; the next session — in the same client or any other MCP client
  pointing at the same project — receives the active handoff at the top of its
  `recall` result (with its `id`) and continues from it. Handoffs live in their
  own supersession-tracked table, not in the digest state snapshot, so a
  handoff written while a digest runs can never be lost to the snapshot's
  read-modify-write, the history is not re-copied on every digest, and each row
  is its own evidence: `why` on the returned `handoffId` walks every stop-point
  the project has recorded. `handoff({ clear: true })` retires the active one
  (recorded, never deleted). The digest writer additionally carries over notes
  written concurrently with a digest run, closing the same lost-update race for
  `remember`. Works in both modes: embedded writes the local store; `--url`
  calls the new `POST /v1/memory/handoff` operation (contract `1.6.0`). Treat a
  received handoff as untrusted data — see the README's security note.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- `remember` now supersedes revisions instead of accumulating near-duplicates.
  When a new note reads as a revision of an active one — most of the note
  matches and only a value moved, "API v1 key…" → "API v2 key…" — it replaces
  that note in the active set and the registry chains old → new via
  `supersededBy`; the old version stays on the record, marked, never deleted,
  and `why` shows the full chain. The matcher keeps short numeric tokens, so
  genuinely distinct short notes ("note-0" vs "note-1") still coexist, and a
  note whose ASCII payload diverges (PostgreSQL vs MySQL behind similar CJK
  context) is treated as a different fact. The `remember` result reports
  `superseded: <old content>` when a chain was created. Exact re-remembers
  remain idempotent no-ops.

- Ship system-prompt instructions in the MCP initialize response. Hosts that
  support the field (Claude Code among them) inject them into the model's
  system prompt every session, so a bare `mcp add` install now teaches the
  model when to act without any extra configuration: call `recall` at session
  start, call `remember` unprompted at the trigger moments (a preference
  stated, a decision made, a gotcha discovered, session-end state worth
  keeping), store the corrected version when a fact changes and let the engine
  chain revisions, and never store secrets. Tool behavior is unchanged.

## 0.2.0

> Housekeeping note: 0.1.0–0.1.2 were versioned by hand before Changesets
> took over this package, so their pending changesets were consumed here.
> The entries below marked "initial release", "shebang", and "registry
> metadata" actually shipped in 0.1.0, 0.1.1, and 0.1.2 respectively; the
> genuinely-new 0.2.0 changes are the `statecore-mcp/lib` library entry and
> the stderr logging fix.

### Minor Changes

- [`a7910e1`](https://github.com/yul761/StateCore/commit/a7910e10522cb8c272c8a1804ba8786d9e7e204a) Thanks [@yul761](https://github.com/yul761)! - Add a public library entry, `statecore-mcp/lib`, exposing the embedded and HTTP
  memory backends, scope-name resolution, and an injectable-LLM digest runner
  (`runScopeDigest`), for the dsh-statecore native plugin to reuse as a
  dependency instead of talking to the MCP server over stdio. Bin behavior is
  unchanged.

- [`7b9bfb1`](https://github.com/yul761/StateCore/commit/7b9bfb1626e9005ad72277bd13f613d12174de9a) Thanks [@yul761](https://github.com/yul761)! - Initial release of the zero-deploy MCP memory server

  `statecore-mcp` exposes the StateCore engine as a five-tool MCP server
  (`remember`, `recall`, `facts`, `why`, `forget`) that a host can install and run
  with no separate deployment: an embedded backend opens a single shared SQLite
  database at `~/.statecore/statecore.db`, scoped per project by git toplevel (or
  `STATECORE_SCOPE`). `remember`/`facts`/`why`/`forget` all work keylessly end to
  end; recall and distillation into keyed facts activate once a model key is
  configured, using DeepSeek's "one key, two uses" reasoning-effort control.

  An `--url` mode targets a self-hosted StateCore gateway instead of the embedded
  backend, sharing the same tool surface and evidence-chain guarantees.

### Patch Changes

- [`de0a02e`](https://github.com/yul761/StateCore/commit/de0a02ee0d16d766bb6fe12088bc5f21e2d0758d) Thanks [@yul761](https://github.com/yul761)! - Library logs go to stderr, never stdout

  `@statecore/core`'s logger wrote to fd 1 with no destination set. `core` is
  workspace-private and ships only inlined into `statecore-mcp`'s bundle, so
  every host that talks to `statecore-mcp` over stdio (MCP stdio, dsh's ACP or
  JSON-RPC transports) had log lines corrupting its protocol stream on every
  `recall()`. The logger now binds to fd 2 explicitly.

- [`415bba4`](https://github.com/yul761/StateCore/commit/415bba445bf77532c50ec222f3bc95fa245531e1) Thanks [@yul761](https://github.com/yul761)! - MCP Registry metadata: `mcpName` ownership field and a `server.json`

  The official registry validates that an npm package claims its server name, via
  an `mcpName` property in `package.json` — absent from 0.1.1, so the registry
  would refuse the listing. No behavior change.

- [`071c37f`](https://github.com/yul761/StateCore/commit/071c37fce2fb6ef2bfe99a41896a3c9870bd498e) Thanks [@yul761](https://github.com/yul761)! - Ship the bin with a shebang

  0.1.0's `dist/main.js` had none, so npm's `.bin` shim handed JavaScript to the
  shell and every `npx statecore-mcp` invocation died on
  `use strict: command not found`. Every test had launched the file via
  `node dist/main.js`, which is exactly why nothing caught it; the e2e now execs
  the built file directly, the way the shim does, and pins the shebang line.
